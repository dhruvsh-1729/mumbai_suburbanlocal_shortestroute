#This project was an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two Mumbai suburban local train stations considering the graph to be undirected. 
- There are many more features that can be now added.
- The routes are not complete yet like the trans harbor route for both Thane to Vashi and CSMT-Andheri has not been added yet.
- Dynamic live factors and distance between stations or the frequency of trains has not been taken into account yet.
- Feel free to contribute to this repository or to reach out to me if we can build this as a more sophisticated application to ease the hassle of Mumbaikars.
